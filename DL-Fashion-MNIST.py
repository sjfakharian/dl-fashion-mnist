#Step 1: Download the dataset
You can download the Fashion-MNIST dataset using the tensorflow.keras.datasets module:
'''

import tensorflow.keras as keras

(X_train, y_train), (X_test, y_test) = keras.datasets.fashion_mnist.load_data()

'''
This code downloads the training and testing subsets of the dataset.

#Step 2: Preprocess the data
Next, you'll need to preprocess the image data. Here's an example of how you can do this:
'''

import numpy as np

# Rescale pixel values to between 0 and 1
X_train = X_train.astype('float32') / 255
X_test = X_test.astype('float32') / 255

# Reshape images to 1D arrays
X_train = np.reshape(X_train, (len(X_train), -1))
X_test = np.reshape(X_test, (len(X_test), -1))

'''
This code rescales the pixel values of the images to between 0 and 1, and reshapes the 2D arrays of images into 1D arrays.

Step 3: Train the model
Now that you've preprocessed the data, you can train a machine learning model on it. Here's an example of how you can train a neural network using the tensorflow.keras library:
'''

from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense, Dropout

model = Sequential()
model.add(Dense(256, activation='relu', input_shape=(784,)))
model.add(Dropout(0.5))
model.add(Dense(128, activation='relu'))
model.add(Dropout(0.5))
model.add(Dense(10, activation='softmax'))

model.compile(loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy', optimizer='adam', metrics=['accuracy'])

model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=128, validation_data=(X_test, y_test))

'''
This code defines a neural network with two hidden layers and a output layer with softmax activation. The Dropout layers are used to prevent overfitting. The model is compiled with categorical cross-entropy loss and the Adam optimizer, and trained on the training data with a batch size of 128 for 10 epochs.

Step 4: Evaluate the model
Once you've trained the model, you can evaluate its performance on the testing data using the evaluate() method:
'''

loss, accuracy = model.evaluate(X_test, y_test)
print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy:.2f}")

'''
This code calculates the loss and accuracy of the model on the testing data.
